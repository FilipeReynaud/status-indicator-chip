Contributing:

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We welcome and value contributions from the community, as they help improve the package and make it more robust for everyone.

If you wish to contribute, here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Create an Issue**: Before starting any work, it's best to discuss your ideas or changes with the maintainers. You can do this by creating an issue on our GitHub repository. Describe the feature you want to add, the bug you want to fix, or the improvement you have in mind.

2. **Fork the Repository**: If you plan to work on an issue or add a new feature, fork the repository to your GitHub account.

3. **Branching Strategy**: Create a new branch from the main branch with a descriptive name (e.g., feat/my-new-feature or bugfix/issue-123). This will help keep the repository organized.

4. **Code Changes**: Make your changes, keeping the coding style consistent with the rest of the project. Write clear commit messages that describe the changes made.

5. **Tests**: If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, please include appropriate tests to ensure the changes work as expected and do not introduce regressions.

6. **Documentation**: If your changes affect the public API or add new functionality, make sure to update the documentation to reflect those changes.

7. **Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request (PR) to the main branch of the original repository. Your PR will be reviewed, and feedback will be provided if necessary.

8. **Code Reviews**: Be prepared to address any feedback from code reviews. Our aim is to maintain high code quality and ensure the best possible contribution.

9. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The CI pipeline will run automated tests on your pull request. Make sure all tests pass before the PR is merged.

10. **Merge**: Once everything is approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.

Remember that all contributions are subject to our code of conduct. We expect all contributors to adhere to it in order to foster an open and inclusive community.

Thank you again for your interest in contributing to our project. Your efforts and contributions are greatly appreciated, and they will help make the "status-indicator-chip" even better for all its users!
